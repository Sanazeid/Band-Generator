# Band-Generator
This is a simple Band Name Generator built with Node.js, Express, and EJS. It randomly combines an adjective and a noun to create a fun band name when the user clicks the "Generate Name" button. The project uses EJS partials for layout, handles form submissions, and includes basic styling support.
